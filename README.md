Both are served from this repository by GitHub Pages. **Every push to `main` redeploys
automatically** — see [Deployment](#deployment).

## What it is

IronLog is a workout journal for strength training. It records what you lifted, how many
reps you got, how long you rested, and whether you beat your previous best — then turns
that into volume trends and personal records you can actually read.

It is a static web app with **no backend**. There is no account system, no database and
no analytics script, because there is no server to have them on. Your training history
lives in your browser's local storage, and you can export all of it as JSON at any time.

## Features

- **Fast set logging** — weight and reps per set, ticked as you go, with your previous
  performance shown beside each field so you never have to recall last week's numbers.
- **Live estimated 1RM** — Epley formula, recalculated as you type.
- **Rest timer** — starts automatically when you complete a set, or on demand. Add 15
  seconds mid-count, and it survives a page reload.
- **Personal records** — three independent records per exercise: heaviest weight, most
  reps, and highest estimated 1RM. The session summary names exactly which you broke.
- **Progress views** — weekly volume bars, muscle-group balance, lifetime totals, and a
  training-day streak. Charts are inline SVG, so no charting library loads.
- **Exercise library** — around 90 common movements grouped by muscle and equipment,
  searchable as you type, plus custom exercises that persist.
- **Session templates** — repeat your last workout with its sets and weights prefilled,
  or start from a Push / Pull / Legs split.
- **Export, import, erase** — your whole history is one JSON document.

## Try it

Open **[the app](https://shogun-support-99.github.io/fitness/app/)** and:

1. Tap **Start empty workout** (or pick a split).
2. Add an exercise — search "bench", pick **Barbell Bench Press**.
3. Enter `80` and `8`, tick the set. The rest timer starts and the 1RM appears.
4. Add a couple more sets, then **Finish workout** to see the summary.
5. Open **Progress** to see the records and weekly volume.

Everything is written to local storage immediately, so a closed tab never costs a session.

## Running it locally

There is no build step and no dependency to install. Serve the repository root with any
static file server:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shogun-support-99/fitness.git
cd fitness
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

Then open http://localhost:8080/ for the landing page and http://localhost:8080/app/ for
the app. Relative paths are used throughout, so the site works from any base path.

## Tests

The training maths, persistence layer, rest timer, exercise library, router and HTML
escaping are unit-tested in Node using the built-in test runner — no test framework to
install:

```bash
node --test "tests/*.test.js"
```

```
# tests 170
# suites 43
# pass 170
# fail 0
```

The tests cover the behaviour that is easy to get subtly wrong: Epley rounding without
binary-float drift, personal records ignoring unticked and incomplete sessions, streak
logic across missed days, ISO week bucketing, corrupt-payload recovery, storage quota
failure, and timer completion semantics.

## Architecture notes

- **No build step.** Plain ES modules loaded by the browser. Nothing to compile, bundle
  or version, so deployment cannot fail on a toolchain change.
- **No runtime dependencies.** No framework, no charting library, no icon font, no
  webfont. The only requests a page makes are for its own files.
- **Views are pure functions of state.** Each view returns an HTML string from the store;
  behaviour is wired once through a delegated listener keyed on `data-action`. That makes
  re-rendering cheap and the flow easy to follow.
- **Testable seams.** `store.js` takes an injected `Storage` and `timer.js` takes an
  injected clock, so both run in Node against fakes instead of a browser.
- **Escape by default.** All user-supplied text passes through `esc()` before reaching
  `innerHTML`; there is a test asserting a stored-XSS payload is neutralised.
- **Relative URLs everywhere.** The app works at `/`, at `/fitness/`, or from a local
  server without any base-path configuration.

## Deployment

Pushes to `main` deploy automatically via GitHub Actions:

1. **`test`** — runs the unit tests, checks every JS module parses, and verifies all local
   links resolve.
2. **`deploy`** — only on `main`, and only after `test` passes. Uploads the repository to
   GitHub Pages and publishes it.

There is nothing to do manually. Commit to `main` and the site updates itself within a
minute or two. Pull requests run the `test` job without deploying, so a broken change is
caught before it can reach production.

Pages is configured with **Source: GitHub Actions** on this repository. Run history:
[Actions](https://github.com/shogun-support-99/fitness/actions).

## Privacy

No data leaves the device. There is no backend, no analytics, no cookies and no
third-party asset. Workouts are stored under a single versioned local storage key and can
be exported or erased from the app's settings screen.

The trade-off is worth stating plainly: because storage is per-browser and per-origin,
clearing site data removes your log, and it does not sync between devices. Export a backup
if your history matters to you.
