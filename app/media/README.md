# Exercise media

This directory contains only exercise media whose in-app redistribution terms
have been checked, plus the documented slot for media a downstream user holds
rights to.

## RepDB free-tier stills

`repdb/` contains **1,147 unmodified 512×512 WebP illustrations** referenced by
the 650 RepDB records in `app/data/repdb-index.json`. They come from
[`RepDB/exercise-dataset`](https://github.com/RepDB/exercise-dataset); the exact
upstream commit is recorded in `app/data/repdb-meta.json`.

**Exercise data by [RepDB](https://repdb.co) (repdb.co).**

The RepDB Free Tier License permits personal and commercial **in-app use** with
visible attribution. It does not permit republishing the data as a standalone
dataset, dataset repository or API. The full terms are retained in
[`LICENSE-REPDB.md`](../../LICENSE-REPDB.md), and attribution is visible in
Settings and on illustrated exercise details.

Only referenced `images/flat/*.webp` files are copied. Upstream
`premium-samples/`, paid-tier animations, classic images and every GIF/video
are excluded. The images are not generatively edited, restyled or used as AI
reference material.

Regenerate from a local upstream checkout with:

```sh
node scripts/build-repdb-data.mjs --source /path/to/exercise-dataset
```

The generator fails if the expected license terms disappear, a media path is
outside the free flat-image directory, or a referenced asset is missing.
`tests/repdb.test.js` verifies all committed records, paths, WebP signatures,
instruction packs and attribution.

## Start, peak and single-pose illustrations

Most RepDB exercises have `start` and `peak` stills. The detail sheet shows the
start position with an accessible Start/Peak switch; this is a still-image
selector, not a copied or generated animation. Stretches and holds with one
`main` image render without empty controls. Every image has explicit dimensions
and lazy loading to avoid layout shifts.

Entries without a RepDB still retain the original movement and muscle diagrams
from `app/js/diagrams.js`.

## Why the other dataset's GIFs are not here

[`hasaneyldrm/exercises-dataset`](https://github.com/hasaneyldrm/exercises-dataset)
has an explicit **MEDIA EXCEPTION**: its images and videos are © Gym Visual and
cloning grants no license to them. IronLog therefore ships none of those GIFs or
thumbnails. The MIT grant still covers that source's exercise data and
instruction text, whose attribution is retained in [`NOTICE`](../../NOTICE).

## Supplying your own media

If you have media you are entitled to publish, place it directly in this
directory (not in `repdb/`) named by exercise id:

```text
app/media/ds-0289.gif
app/media/ds-0289.webp
app/media/ds-0289.mp4
app/media/ds-0289.jpg
```

Then call `exerciseMedia(exercise, { mediaUrl, mediaCredit })` with the resolved
URL. An explicitly supplied file takes precedence over catalogue artwork. For
Gym Visual media, a separate license is still required and the credit
`© Gym visual — https://gymvisual.com/` is not optional.

## Guards

`tests/catalogue.test.js` keeps the original Gym Visual media block intact.
`tests/repdb.test.js` checks the separate RepDB free-tier grant and assets. The
deploy workflow allows binary exercise media only under `app/media/repdb/` and
rejects unexpected images, videos, premium paths and missing attribution.
